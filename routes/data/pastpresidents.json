        "Shubho Bijoya to everyone!",

        "Thanks to your participation, we all enjoyed a memorable Durga Puja experience this year. With sunny skies outside and the joyful minds inside, Bartlett High School came alive with the true spirit of Puja as Ma Durga showered her benevolence on us.  We had a record attendance of approximately 700 on Friday, 1400 on Saturday, and 900 on Sunday.  Various activities ran harmoniously without incident.  Words cannot express my gratitude towards my team and the large number of volunteers without whose tireless efforts, this mega event would not be possible.  However much I would like to, I will not be naming volunteers individually.  We will be publishing a list of volunteers on the BAGC website soon.",

        "I would also like to thank our corporate and member sponsors, whose contributions make a program of this magnitude financially viable.",

        "The Puja was conducted with utmost devotion and meticulousness.  This is a herculean undertaking where all members and attendees are able to experience and avail of every aspect of the Puja, offer Anjali and come away with a sense of peace and satisfaction.",

        "Our New Protima, with the fabulous decoration was welcomed enthusiastically by one and all.",

        "The record number of attendees were processed through the registration system, with minimal glitches. Everyone enjoyed a delicious variety of cuisine on all three days and each day culminated with an amazing array of cultural programs, by both our community as well as guest artists.",

        "Our Annual Sharadiya magazine was very nicely compiled and the distribution process was started at Durga Puja.  The remaining copies will be available for distribution at Kali Puja.",

        "Once again, every aspect was made possible by the talents and efforts of our volunteers and members.  My heartfelt thanks to all.",

        "While we made our best attempt to run everything flawlessly, we do acknowledge that some things could be done better.  We will incorporate these improvements in the future and pass along lessons learnt to the next committee.",

        "We now look forward to seeing you at Kali Puja, being celebrated on Saturday, Nov 7th at Streamwood High School.",

        "We will also be having our Annual General Body Meeting at Kali Puja.  Please be present on time to participate in this important event.  We will be publishing the agenda soon.",
